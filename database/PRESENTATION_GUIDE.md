  - Different user types (Student, Staff, Supervisor, Admin)
  - Document workflow (draft ‚Üí review ‚Üí approval)
  - Metadata relationships

### **3. Business Rules Implementation (8-10 minutes)**
- **File to use:** `database/business_rules_demo.sql`
- **What to demonstrate:**
  - Each business rule with corresponding SQL query
  - Data integrity enforcement
  - Role-based access demonstrations
  - Audit trail functionality

### **4. Advanced Queries & Analytics (5-7 minutes)**
- **What to demonstrate:**

## üñ•Ô∏è Presentation Setup Options

### **Option A: MySQL Workbench (Recommended)**
1. **Open MySQL Workbench**
2. **Connect to your database**
3. **Load and execute scripts in this order:**
   ```
   1. complete_schema.sql
   2. sample_data.sql  
   3. business_rules_demo.sql
   ```

### **Option B: Command Line MySQL**
1. **Open Command Prompt/Terminal**
2. **Connect to MySQL:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p260307
   ```
3. **Execute scripts:**
   ```sql
   source C:/path/to/complete_schema.sql;
   source C:/path/to/sample_data.sql;
   source C:/path/to/business_rules_demo.sql;
   ```

### **Option C: Web-based (phpMyAdmin)**

## üìã Presentation Script

### **Opening (1 minute)**
"Today I'll demonstrate the SQL implementation of an Academic Research Repository System that manages research documents across university departments with role-based access control and comprehensive audit trails."

### **Schema Presentation (5 minutes)**
"Let me start by showing the complete database schema..."
```sql
-- Show table creation from complete_schema.sql
SHOW TABLES;
DESCRIBE users;
DESCRIBE documents;
```

### **Business Rules Demo (8 minutes)**
"Now I'll demonstrate how business rules are enforced through SQL..."
```sql
-- Example: Show role-based document access
SELECT u.name, u.role, COUNT(d.id) as documents_uploaded
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN documents d ON u.id = d.uploader_id
GROUP BY u.id, u.name, u.role;
```

### **Advanced Analytics (5 minutes)**
"Finally, here are some advanced queries for system analytics..."
```sql
-- Show department performance
SELECT dept.name, COUNT(d.id) as total_docs,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN d.status = 'approved' THEN 1 END) as approved
FROM departments dept
LEFT JOIN documents d ON dept.id = d.department_id
GROUP BY dept.id, dept.name;
```

## üéØ Questions You Might Get

### **Q: "How do you ensure data integrity?"**
**A:** "Through foreign key constraints, CHECK constraints, and triggers. For example, only users with role 'supervisor' can approve documents."

### **Q: "How is the audit trail implemented?"**
**A:** "Every major action triggers an audit log entry automatically using database triggers, ensuring complete traceability."

### **Q: "How do you handle role-based access?"**
**A:** "The user table has role enum, and business logic ensures only appropriate roles can perform specific actions through CHECK constraints."

### **Q: "What about database performance?"**
**A:** "We use strategic indexes on frequently queried columns like email, role, department_id, and document status."
